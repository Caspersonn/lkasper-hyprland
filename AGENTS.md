ALWAYS follow these rules:
- Never git commit, add or push anything
- Do not add markdown files anywhere, except for the `openspec/` directory
- Never add comments inside code files
- When something is unclear, ask the user a question instead of guessing
- You do not have to validate/test code
- NEVER fix whitespaces
